"Consultant" - A Clean Code Kata
================================

This project contains bad unclean code. The point of this is to take
it as it is, read through and then start refactoring it (or rewriting)
to make it better.

Good luck. :)


Project Overview
----------------

The overall goal here is to process a month's work and send out invoices.
Job should be carried out in this order: the most risky jobs first.
Invoices should be sent using an appropriate "service", sending e-mail
if that's what the customer wants, or a fax or by paper/letter/postal
service.
